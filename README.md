# Building Blocks

Building Blocks is an educational quiz game built in Unity for Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 students. It helps children practice Mathematics, English, and Science through interactive quizzes that increase in difficulty from Year 1 to Year 6. The project is designed to be easy to expand, with all quiz content stored in external CSV files rather than hardcoded into the application.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Multiple Subjects:** Practice Mathematics, English, and Science from a single application.
- **Six Difficulty Levels:** Questions are organised into Levels 1 to 6, matching the UK primary school curriculum from Year 1 through Year 6.
- **Data-Driven Content:** Quiz questions are loaded from external CSV files, making it easy to add or update content without changing the code.
- **Progress Tracking:** Completion progress and star ratings are saved locally so students can continue where they left off.
- **Navigation History:** A stack-based navigation system allows the Back button to return users to the previous screen instead of always returning to the main menu.

### Accessibility

- **Adjustable Text Size:** Increase or decrease font size to improve readability.
- **Multiple Font Options:** Choose from different fonts to suit individual reading preferences.
- **Responsive Interface:** Menus and quiz screens automatically adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
